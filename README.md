pitchfork_visualization
=======================

An animated visualization that shows all the perturbed and unperturbed
bifurcation diagrams of the pitchfork.

Specifically, a visualization of a universal unfolding of a pitchfork
bifurcation:

         G(x,lambda; alpha) = x^3 + lambda*x + alpha_1*x^2 - alpha_2

where dx/dt + G(x, lambda; alpha) = 0, lambda is the main parameter, and
alpha_1 and alpha_2 are auxiliary parameters.
